  The record update syntax can be used to create a new record from an existing
  one of the same type, but with some fields changed.
</p>
<p>
  The accessor syntax can only be used for fields that are in the same position
  and have the same type for all variants of the custom type.

<p>
  Gleam is an immutable language, so using the record update syntax does not
  mutate or otherwise change the original record.
