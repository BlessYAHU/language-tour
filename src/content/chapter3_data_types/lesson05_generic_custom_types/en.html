  Like functions, custom types can also be generic, taking contained types as
  parameters.

  Here a generic <code>Option</code> type is defined, which is used to represent
  a value that is either present or absent. This type is quite useful! The
  <code>gleam/option</code> module defines it so you can use it in your Gleam
  projects.
